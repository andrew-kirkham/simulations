Homework 2 questions
    1. Write your own implementation of the Box-Muller method 
        (transformation from uniform to normal)
    2. Use the function
        f(x) = c/(1+(x-x0)^2/a)
        based on the Lorentzian distribution in the rejection method to
        generate random variables from the Gamma distribution
        Consider the case where n=5. 
            Note a, c, x0 are parameters chosen to ensure that f(x) >=p(x) for all x
        what is the area under f(x) for the parameters you chose?
        what fraction of candidate samples did you anticipate to be rejected?
        What fraction of candidate samples were rejected?
